def read(db_name: str, *, start: int = None, end: int = None) -> bytes:
	"""
		Read the content of a file as bytes. Reading works even when the config
		changes, so a compressed ddb file can also be read if compression is
		disabled, and vice versa.

		If no compression is used, efficient reading can be done by specifying a start
		and end byte index, such that only the bytes in that range are read from the
		file.

		If compression is used, specifying a start and end byte index is still possible,
		but the entire file has to be read and decompressed first, and then the bytes
		in the range are returned. This is because the compressed file is not seekable.

		Args:
		- `db_name`: The name of the database file to read from.
		- `start`: The start byte index to read from.
		- `end`: The end byte index to read up to (not included).

		Raises:
		- `FileNotFoundError`: If the file does not exist as .json nor .ddb.
		- `OSError`: If no compression is used and `start` is negative.
		- `FileExistsError`: If the file exists as .json and .ddb.
